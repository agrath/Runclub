    "question": "What do I need to bring",
    "answer": "Yourself and a friend or two! If it’s summer then sunscreen and sunglasses are always a good idea!<br/>You don’t need any special gear to run with us but a running watch can help you keep the pace. Not all of our routes have water stops so a running pack or bottles can be a good idea too."

    "category": "Sunday runs",
    "question": "What speed do you run?",
    "answer": "At the start of our group run we break into pace groups of 4:30/km through to 7:00/km at intervals of 30s. We call these runs LSR (long slow run) and you should aim to run at a slow conversational pace."

  {
    "category": "Sunday runs",
    "question": "Is there somewhere to put my keys",
    "answer": "During the Sunday group run, most of us run with our keys on us. If you're running in one of the larger groups, you may be able to put your keys in someone else's running pack or car."
