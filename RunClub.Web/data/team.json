    "about": "<p>Hi, I’m Susie and I started running in the early 90’s, about 1991 or 1992, as a social activity really. I joined a group called the Hash House Harriers which started in Malaysia but now are worldwide and whose tag line is ‘A Running club with a drinking problem or a drinking club with a running problem’. Take your pick! I remember my first run vividly, I thought I was going to collapse it was so hard given the last time I’d run had been at school many, many years before. </p><p>Extremely slowly I managed to improve enough to feel confident to run a 10k with some friends and then a few years later, those same group of so called friends, managed to persuade me to enter the New York City marathon. It was a weak moment and I definitely think alcohol may have been involved! We all trained together and travelled together and even though I was last of our group to cross the finish line, the celebrations more than made up for it. </p><p>So 5 marathons, numerous half marathons, 10k and 5k runs later, here I am at that stage in my running where I know I’m a lot slower than I was 10 or more years ago but my enthusiasm for the sport is still there. I’ve been away from it and come back several times but it’s always been there to keep me going whatever has happened in my life, both the good and the bad. I have met some amazing people through running through the Hash, Park Run and MetroRun and the best thing is we all have the same goal – to enjoy running but don’t take it too seriously! </p>"

After training alone for two half-marathons, Julie joined TempoFit for the company and motivation of training with a group. Although some of her fellow runners suspect Julie is also motivated by gloating to her friends at Sunday lunch about how far she ran that morning (and using that to justify another glass of wine!), she does keep coming to training and has now been running consistently for 2 years since joining TempoFit and has completed another 6 half marathons. Julie is our Treasurer and plans the programme of Sunday morning long runs.</p>"

    "about": "<p>My name is Chloé Griveaud I am French and been living in New Zealand for 7 years. I originally came over for a holiday and never left!<br/>I have always been a very sporty person and always enjoyed practising various sports. I mainly did horse-riding back in France for over 14 years and was competing in eventing. When I moved to New Zealand I felt the need to start something different and thought running would be a good challenge as there is that competing aspect to it.</p><p>Maybe around 3 years ish. I am new to the sport and therefore don’t really know all the lingo and events around but I am getting better!</p>Most memorable achievement: Running my second marathon 26 mins faster than I did from the one the year before!</p><ul><li><strong>What keeps you motivated?</strong><br/>The sense of achievement that you get when you cross that finish line when you are participating at an event.</li><li><strong>Do you mix it up? Do different stuff apart from running?</strong><br/>Yoga, swimming, gym, hiking... I am on the move most of the time.</li><li><strong>When you go on holiday, do you take your running stuff with you and look at places as potential good run routes?</strong><br/>Ahaha maybe because I haven’t been running for long I am not at that stage yet. But most of my holidays always involve some physical activities.</li><li><strong>Do you enjoy an extra beer/wine/piece of cake because you went for a long run or a run anyway?</strong><br/>Absolutely but always in moderation :)</li><li><strong>Do you feel smug having got up early on a Sunday for a run when everyone else is in bed?</strong><br/>It is such a satisfying feeling when returning from an early run you have got the sense you have already accomplished something of your day when everyone else hasn’t.</li><li><strong>Do you friends understand your love of running?</strong><br/>They understand the running but not for more than 5K!</li><li><strong>Do you need so many running shoes?</strong><br/>I started off with one pair which turned out to not be properly suited for my running style so then I went to get a new pair and now I have a training pair and a pair for events.</li><li><strong>Would you rather shop in a running/sports shop or fashion clothes shop/Mitre 10?</strong><br/>I love looking after my plants and garden so I actually love going to Mitre 10!</li><li><strong>Do you bore non-runners with your running stories but don’t really care?</strong><br/>I seem to talk about my running stories to the people that are runners so they would sympathise.</li></ul>"
