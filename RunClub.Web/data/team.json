    "about": "<p>Hi, I’m Susie and I started running in the early 90’s, about 1991 or 1992, as a social activity really. I joined a group called the Hash House Harriers which started in Malaysia but now are worldwide and whose tag line is ‘A Running club with a drinking problem or a drinking club with a running problem’. Take your pick! I remember my first run vividly, I thought I was going to collapse it was so hard given the last time I’d run had been at school many, many years before. </p><p>Extremely slowly I managed to improve enough to feel confident to run a 10k with some friends and then a few years later, those same group of so called friends, managed to persuade me to enter the New York City marathon. It was a weak moment and I definitely think alcohol may have been involved! We all trained together and travelled together and even though I was last of our group to cross the finish line, the celebrations more than made up for it. </p><p>So 5 marathons, numerous half marathons, 10k and 5k runs later, here I am at that stage in my running where I know I’m a lot slower than I was 10 or more years ago but my enthusiasm for the sport is still there. I’ve been away from it and come back several times but it’s always been there to keep me going whatever has happened in my life, both the good and the bad. I have met some amazing people through running through the Hash, Park Run and MetroRun and the best thing is we all have the same goal – to enjoy running but don’t take it too seriously! </p>"  },
