        <p class="lead text-muted">
        <p>
            Every Sunday at 8am join a small army of runners to explore Auckland’s most beautiful spots on foot.<br />
            Join our Auckland Sunday running group!
        </p>
        <p>
            These social runs are totally free-of-charge and ideal for EVERY level of runner. Plus, you don’t have to be a club member.<br />
            At every run we have options to complete just 5k all the way up to 30k +.
        </p>
        <p>
            Our pace leaders guide groups at the following paces: 4:30, 5, 5:30, 6, & 6:30 min/km (we’re currently looking for a 7:00 min/km leader).<br />
            So find a group that works for you and enjoy discovering Auckland’s best runs with great company.
        </p>
        <p>And we’re on rain, hail or shine.</p>
        <p>NOTE: All runners run at their own risk and agree not to hold the club or any run leaders responsible for any injury or damages to their person or belongings.</p>
